## Introduction

Your Web3Auth account is a cryptographic key that acts as a proxy to traditional SSOs. Accounts are secured across user devices and authentication methods - there is no central server, no data honey pot.
It combines both [CustomAuth](https://github.com/torusresearch/CustomAuth) and [tKey](https://github.com/tkey/tkey) and provides you with a nice UI and UX flows

## Features

- Typescript compatible. Includes Type definitions

Please refer to docs for API Reference available [here](https://docs.tor.us/open-login/api-reference/installation).

## Installation

### Bundling

Each sub package is distributed in 3 formats

- `esm` build `dist/<MODULE_NAME>.esm.js` in es6 format
- `commonjs` build `dist/<MODULE_NAME>.cjs.js` in es5 format
- `umd` build `dist/<MODULE_NAME>.umd.min.js` in es5 format without polyfilling corejs minified

By default, the appropriate format is used for your specified usecase
You can use a different format (if you know what you're doing) by referencing the correct file

The cjs build is not polyfilled with core-js.
It is upto the user to polyfill based on the browserlist they target
